      Definition of an extension to the domain model defined directly by a user in the RAML/OpenAPI document.
      This can be achieved by using an annotationType in RAML. In OpenAPI thy don't need to
            be declared, they can just be used.
            This should be mapped to new RDF properties declared directly in the main document or module.
            Contrast this extension mechanism with the creation of a propertyTerm in a vocabulary, a more
      re-usable and generic way of achieving the same functionality.
      It can be validated using a SHACL shape
